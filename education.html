	but these are all the subjects which I am annoyed at when people are being annoying becuase there is a different teacher: Art and PE. Like I said,
	I like PE (and Art is pretty good as well), but when people are being annoying in the lesson I get annoyed!</td>

		  who is going to teach us for the whole day, or even the whole week!</td>
          <td>When I was in Year 4, at first, I had 2 teachers, and I was fine with that, but then, after a while, one of them left! And then the other also
		  left after a while as well! We had loads of supply teachers throughout the year, and at one point in the year, we had 3 teachers, including
		  the deputy head and the assistant head of the school! The other one had just joined. No-one was nice to the new one. There were always very silly
		  when she came, but they were nice when the deputy or assistant head had come (they were especially nice to the assistant head, because he always gave
		  out good books to everyone). If everyone was being silly while the new teacher was here, and then the assistant head came in, then they would be silent
		  and behave straight away! I don't really know the reason why everyone was really nice to the deputy head though. I think it was because she had
		  lots of power over them, so then they thought that the deputy head would know worse punishments than the new teacher.</td>

  I don't think that I have any more to speak about in my Education Page, and even if I do, then it would be very long stories like the story
		  about my Year 4 life at school. Contact me from my Contact Page if you DO want more of these stories, though!</td>
		  <p> When quarantine had started, my school had used an app called Seesaw. They didn't actually do zoom meetings (well, not yet...). I guess
		  when I had started Seesaw, they put pretty easy work on. In my school, there was something called Pen Licence (when you are allowed to write with a pen).
		  I was in Year 5 that time. When I had started in Year 5, I had REALLY BAD handwriting. And I thought that it would stay like that. But then, I really
		  tried hard on it, and then I was really close to getting Pen Licence!!! But then quarantine had started, and my handwriting had gotten much bigger
		  and worse overtime. But then, when Year 6 had started and I was back at school, I STILL tried VERY hard to get it. And then I got it!!! I was VERY
		  HAPPY that day, but then another quarantine started. My handwriting has gotten much worse again, but this time instead of bigger I think that my handwriting
		  has become a bit SMALLER instead. But I will still probably try hard in school to keep my Pen Licence. Anyway, now, RIGHT now, we ARE having Zoom Meetings,
		  but only once a day in the morning, starting at 9:15 and ending at usually 9:45. I can't wait to get back to school in my new classrom. The teacher and the children
		  in my class are going to see this.
