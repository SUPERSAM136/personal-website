    <h1>Welcome to my Website which is about me and my interest!</h1>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my Website. There are three buttons at the top of the website which will take you to My Hobbies, where to Contact Me, my Education Page and more! <br>
Enjoy! 	</p>
<p> One of my instrests are playing games, such as <a href="https://www.friv.com/"> FRIV!!!</a>
<p> Also, my favourite games are Brawl Stars (as first place), Roblox (as second place) and Crossy Road and Subway Surf (tied as third place). There are more games that I like, but those are some of my favourites.<br>
If you like this website, then make sure to contact me from my contact page! By the way, there is only one more thing that I like more than Brawl Stars. That thing is every Marvel Studios film (especially Avengers Endgame, which is my favourite movie, and Avengers Infinity War is my second). Have Fun!!!</p>
